# WarnABrotha (WIP)

A parking enforcement tracking app for UC Davis students. Get real-time alerts when TAPS is spotted at your parking structure, check probability predictions, and help the community by reporting sightings.

## Overview

WarnABrotha helps UC Davis students avoid parking tickets by:

- **Real-time Alerts**: Get notified instantly when TAPS is spotted at your parking lot
- **Check In/Out**: Register when you park to receive location-specific notifications
- **Community Reports**: Report TAPS sightings to warn fellow parkers
- **Reliability Voting**: Upvote/downvote reports to help identify accurate sightings
- **AI Predictions**: View probability predictions based on time, day, historical data, and academic calendar
- **3-Hour Reminders**: Automatic reminder to check out if you forget

### How It Works

1. **Register** your device and verify your UC Davis email
2. **Check in** when you park at a structure (e.g., Hutchinson)
3. **Receive alerts** if someone spots TAPS at your lot
4. **Report sightings** when you see TAPS to help others
5. **Vote on reports** to indicate reliability (thumbs up/down)
6. **Check out** when you leave

## Backend

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Python FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy (async)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens + UC Davis email verification
- **Notifications**: APNs push notifications + in-app polling fallback
- **Background Tasks**: APScheduler for checkout reminders
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose

## Frontend

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: SwiftUI (iOS)
- **Design**: Retro/pixelated, gamified UI

### App Structure

The app has two main tabs:

#### Tab 1: Buttons
- **Red "I saw TAPS" button**: Report a sighting (with confirmation popup)
- **Green "I parked at ___" button**: Check in to receive notifications
  - Transforms to **Yellow "I am leaving ___"** after check-in
- 3-hour automatic reminder if you don't check out

#### Tab 2: Probability & Feed
- **Probability Display**:
  - Animated counter (0-100%)
  - Color-coded: 🟢 Green (<33%) | 🟡 Yellow (33-66%) | 🔴 Red (>66%)
- **Recent Feed**:
  - Sightings from last 3 hours
  - Ordered by timestamp (newest first)
  - Thumbs up/down voting for reliability
  - Shows upvote/downvote counts and net score

### Supported Parking Structures

Currently tracking:
- Hutchinson Parking Structure

*More locations coming soon!*
