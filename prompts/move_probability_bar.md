# UI Update
I need you to significnatly modify the UI. Read to find out more.


## Prep Work
Make sure to read through all the existing code before making changes to understand the current layout. As a rule of thumb, always do this before making changes.

## Changes

### Move Probability Bar
There is a probability bar asset at the top of the reporting page. This is a great asset, and its actual implementation should not be modified at all. I would like for this bar to occupy the currently empty space above the reporting buttons. This means the second tab (Feed) should only be the reports, and in the case there are no reports in the past day you should have a message + icon explaining that.
