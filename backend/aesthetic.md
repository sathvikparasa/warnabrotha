# Aesthetic

I want the overall aesthetic of the app to mimic Windows 95. THe retro, blocky icons; the pixelated yet homey feel. I want this app to feel almost analog.

## RULES

1. Everything needs to be accessible. I believe Windows 95 in general is like this anyways.
2. ALWAYS adhere to Windows 95 styling.
3. Use simple colors whenever possible.

## Buttons

The buttons should be big and take up half of the screen each on the buttons tab. The shape should be pixealted circle (looks almost like a square with pixealted curved corners). Text should be big, all caps, and white on the buttons, black if white is not readable on the color.

## Probability Meter

Make it a loading bar. Display probability as a percent.

## Feed (under meter)

Each alert should appear like a Windows pop-up menu.
